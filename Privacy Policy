Thank you for using Ethelix, a music bot designed to enhance your experience on Discord! Your privacy is important to us, and this Privacy Policy explains how Ethelix collects, uses, and protects your data. By using Ethelix, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

1. Information We Collect
Ethelix collects minimal information necessary to provide its services. The types of information collected include:

Server Data: This includes the server’s name, ID, and configuration settings related to Ethelix’s functionality, such as permission roles, volume settings, and song queues.

Command Logs: Ethelix records commands issued by users to enable proper functionality (e.g., play, skip, pause commands). These logs help maintain proper bot performance and troubleshoot potential issues.

User Interaction Data: Ethelix may collect information about how users interact with the bot, such as the songs requested, time spent listening to music, and interaction frequency. However, no personally identifiable information (PII) such as your Discord username, email, or other account details is stored by Ethelix.

Ethelix does not collect sensitive personal information, financial information, or location data.

2. How We Use the Information
The data collected is used solely to improve the functionality and performance of Ethelix. Specifically, we use the data to:

Operate and maintain the bot’s features, including managing music queues, volume settings, and playlists.
Monitor server settings to ensure Ethelix runs smoothly in your Discord server.
Analyze command usage to improve performance and add new features.
Troubleshoot bugs, technical issues, or bot malfunctions.
We do not use your data for advertising or marketing purposes.

3. Data Sharing and Disclosure
Ethelix does not share, sell, or disclose your information to third parties, except under the following circumstances:

With your consent: If you request support or provide feedback, we may share specific data related to your inquiry (such as bot usage logs) to resolve the issue.
Legal obligations: Ethelix may share data if required to do so by law, such as in response to a legal request, court order, or government investigation.
We do not sell or trade your data for commercial purposes.

4. Data Retention
We retain collected data only as long as necessary to provide Ethelix’s services or as required by law. Specifically:

Server and configuration data: Stored as long as Ethelix is active in your server. When the bot is removed, all stored configurations and settings related to that server are deleted.
Command logs and user interactions: Kept for a limited time to assist with troubleshooting and improving performance. Typically, these logs are automatically deleted after [insert timeframe, e.g., 30 days].
5. Security of Your Information
We prioritize protecting the data we collect through Ethelix. We use reasonable technical and administrative measures to safeguard your data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of data transmission or storage is completely secure, and while we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

As a user of Ethelix, you have the following rights concerning your data:

Access: You can request to know what data Ethelix has collected about you (if any).

7. Third-Party Services
Ethelix relies on third-party platforms (e.g., YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud) to stream music. These platforms may collect their own data when users interact with their services via Ethelix. Please review the privacy policies of these third-party services for details on how they handle your data. Ethelix is not responsible for the data collection practices of these third-party services.
