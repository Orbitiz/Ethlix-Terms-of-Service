Ethelix is a Discord bot designed to enhance your server's music experience. It allows users to stream music, create playlists, and interact with audio content from various sources. Key features include:

Playing music from services such as YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud, and more.
Managing a queue of songs (adding, removing, skipping, shuffling tracks).

3. Usage Rules
By using Ethelix, you agree to the following guidelines:

Respect intellectual property rights. Do not use Ethelix to play or stream content in violation of any copyright, trademark, or intellectual property laws. You must ensure that any content streamed via the bot is used lawfully and in compliance with licensing agreements.

No spamming or disruptive use. Do not spam commands or disrupt the flow of audio by excessively queuing or playing songs in a way that negatively affects other users.

No exploitation or abuse. You must not abuse, exploit, reverse-engineer, or manipulate Ethelix in any way to harm the bot, its users, or the Discord servers it is added to.

Server administration responsibility. Server owners and administrators are responsible for managing Ethelix’s permissions and ensuring its use aligns with the Discord community standards, as well as their own server rules.

4. Third-Party Services
Ethelix relies on external services, such as YouTube, SoundCloud, and Spotify, to provide audio streaming. When using Ethelix, you agree to the following:

Third-party terms. You must comply with the Terms of Service and privacy policies of any third-party services used in conjunction with Ethelix. The bot merely streams content and has no control over the policies or functionality of these services.

No liability for third-party issues. Ethelix is not responsible for outages, changes, or restrictions imposed by third-party platforms that may affect its functionality, including content removal or changes to API access.

Data and bandwidth usage. Users are responsible for any costs incurred through the use of third-party services, including data and bandwidth usage.

5. Changes and Updates
Ethelix is continually updated to improve performance and add new features. You acknowledge that:

Features and functionality may be added, modified, or removed at any time, with or without prior notice.
Ethelix’s development team is not obligated to maintain specific features or offer long-term support for particular capabilities.
Any updates to the Terms of Service will be communicated via announcements, either in the bot's official Discord server or other official communication channels. Continued use of Ethelix after such changes are made constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.
6. Accountability and Moderation
